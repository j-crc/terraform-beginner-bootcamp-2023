### Semantic versioning
This project is going to utilize semantic versioning for its branching. See more at the  [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/) website.

The general format will be MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH. Eg.: `1.0.1`.

- MAJOR version when you make **incompatible API changes**
- MINOR version when you **add functionality in a backward compatible manner**
- PATCH version when you **make backward compatible bug fixes**

Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.
